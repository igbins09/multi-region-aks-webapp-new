# Multi-Region AKS Web App with High Availability and Disaster Recovery

This project deploys a highly available Node.js web application across two Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters in East US and West US, leveraging Azure Front Door for global load balancing and failover. It includes observability with Azure Monitor and Log Analytics, a basic disaster recovery plan, and cost optimization tracked via Azure Cost Managementâ€”demonstrating senior-level DevOps skills in multi-region architecture and production-ready systems.

## Project Objective
Build a web app on AKS that spans multiple regions, ensuring 99.99% uptime, automated failover, real-time monitoring, and disaster recovery, while keeping costs optimized.

- Users access the app via Azure Front Door, which routes traffic to the nearest healthy AKS cluster.
- Two AKS clusters (East US and West US) host the Node.js app, deployed via Helm.
- Azure Monitor collects logs and metrics for observability.
- Manual snapshots enable disaster recovery.
